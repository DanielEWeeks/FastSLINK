/*This file is part of a C version of SLINK a simulation program based
on the LINKAGE package. SLINK was originally described in: D. E.
Weeks, J. Ott, G. M. Lathrop (1990), SLINK: a general simulation
program for linkage analysis, American Journal of Human Genetics
47(1990), A204 (abstract). This version of SLINK is adapted to use the
faster pedigree traversal algorithms described in: R. W. Cottingham
Jr., R. M. Idury, A. A. Schaffer (1993), Faster sequential genetic
linkage computations, American Journal of Human Genetics 53(1993), pp.
252-263. */
